## About - OpenRegistry

We are a small team of developers working towards decentralizing the container experience.
OpenRegistry is open source and aims on remaining so forever. Checkout [what are containers](/guide/documentation.md) for extensive guide and journey of a container.
The idea of decentralization is what drives us.  
We're motivated to take on centralized services and making them decentralized. OpenRegistry is our initiative/ first step towards achieving that goal.
We are committed to bring the change and make this product for people by people.
